# Error Handling

Software errors can happen anywhere in your application. When they do, it may be important to communicate and cascade up meaningful error responses to the consumers of the service.

## Problem Details (RFC 7807)

Scaffold implements [RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) for communicating most errors to consumers of the service in a machine readable format. Error responses are returned in the media type formats `application/problem+json` or `application/problem+xml`.

The following is an example error response from the service in JSON;

```json
{
  "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.8",
  "title": "Conflict",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "Bucket '1' is full. Cannot add Item to Bucket.",
  "traceId": "00-50eecc9647dd4a47bce7f69cfc683d98-13025c0ce39c224e-00"
}
```

And the same response in XML;

```xml
<problem xmlns="urn:ietf:rfc:7807">
  <detail>Bucket '1' is full. Cannot add Item to Bucket.</detail>
  <status>409</status>
  <title>Conflict</title>
  <type>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.8</type>
  <traceId>00-50eecc9647dd4a47bce7f69cfc683d98-13025c0ce39c224e-00</traceId>
</problem>
```

Error responses by default include a `traceId` property. This `traceId` property is a [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context).

## Exception Mapping

Scaffold uses an [exception filter](../Sources/Scaffold.WebApi/Filters/ExceptionFilter.cs) in the ASP.NET Core MVC filter pipeline to catch exceptions and convert them into a _Problem Details_ response. Exceptions that are not caught by the exception filter are not converted in to a _Problem Details_ response and is instead handled in the middleware pipeline.
