# Remote Development

Scaffold includes configuration which you can use with [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces) to spin up a remote development environment. This is ideal for those who want to;

- Use a sandboxed development environment.
- Get started faster with a consistent development environment.

Other [remote development scenarios](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) are also possible but require further configuration. Learn more about remote developer and development containers from [containers.dev](https://containers.dev).

## Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers

For this development experience to work, only the following need to be installed on your local machine.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

All other tooling should already be installed inside the development container. You are also welcomed to install your own.

## GitHub Codespaces

The same configuration for _Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers_ can also be used with _GitHub Codespaces_ to spin up a remote development environment. This development environment can be accessed from a web browser or in _Visual Studio Code_ with the [GitHub Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces).
