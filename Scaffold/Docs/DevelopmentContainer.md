# Development Container

Scaffold includes configuration which you can use with the [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension to spin up a development container. This is ideal for those who want to;

- Use a sandboxed development environment.
- Get started faster with a consistent development environment.

Only the following need to be installed on your local machine for this development experience to work.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

All other tooling should already be installed inside the development container. You are also welcomed to install your own.
